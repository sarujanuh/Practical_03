Use a histogram to show the **shape of a numerical distribution**, for example student heights.

```r
# Basic histogram
hist(df$height_cm)

# Improved histogram
hist(
  df$height_cm[df$gender == "Woman"],
  breaks = 10,
  xlab = "Height (cm bands of 5)",
  ylab = "Frequency",
  main = "Female Height on 7COM1079",
  col  = "steelblue",
  xlim = c(140, 180)
)
